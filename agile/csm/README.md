# Agile CSM Certification Class Notes
# 5/23/21 - 5/24/21

# Getting people into scrum
* important part of being master is bringing people into scrum at their own pace
* Scrum requires intrinsic motivation, you cannot drag people into scrum.

# Agile Overview

## Common Terms
* Framework = agile methods are frameworks, not methodologies; they are very light-weight
* minimizing risk = The guiding purpose and ultimate benefit of Agile Development
* Time box / iterations = instead of BDUF (big design up front) inspect an adpat cycles allow the right choices to make themselves know.
* Working product = scrum is based onn empirical evidence
* impediment = a process or condidion that exists today in your organization that is not in its best long-term interests

## History of scrum

The term scrum comes from rugby

Teams seem to be efficient when everyone has their own specialized skillset, they work well together when it is almost like a relay race where you pass the baton off to another person

Rugby requires that you pass behind or aside to you. You have to work as a team. You have to stick together to accomplish your goal.

* Built-in insetabililty
* self-organizing teams
* OOverlapping development phases
* multti-learning
* suble control
* organizational transfer of learning

# Types of agile

Agile is a group of practices

* Individuals and interactions over process and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentaiton
* Customer collaboration over contract negiotiaoin
* responding to change over following a plan



```
...a conceptual framework for developing new products that seeks to minimize risk and maximize value by working in time-boxed iterattions and emphasizing working product as the primary measure of success
```
*--30 days to better agile*


What scrum brings you The most business value possible for the time and money you have to spend.

This allows teams to not do low value work, they work harder. Not smarter.


## SCRUM
 

### what does it even do?


Wit scrum every day you kjonw exactly
* what work is complete
* what is left to do
* How does whats left compare with with time left to do it


Iterate. Inspect. Adapt.

Summed up. It is an agille project management framework. An approach for managing projects or other bodies of work. It exposes organizational impediments

# Complex projects
The worst part about the project is what you don't know.


# Anarchy

You don't want a project to be in anarchy, always be in control.
# Waterfall projects

Also called defined processes. As soon as any of these are not the case, SCRUM is better.

* Short
* Well understood
* Have already done many times
### Where scrum can help

1) project of higher than average risk
  a) big (long, lots of people)
2) One of more of resources is uncomfortably limited
3) A project that has emerging requirements

## XP

XP improves technical quality. Typically used by small companies, typically cutting edge tech.

* TCO - total cost ownership. The amount of cost for technical debt and maintencance.

## Lean

Continious improvement, eliminiate waste.

## Kanban

You have a list of things. If space opens up, you have an opening and take somethting off backlog. Otherwise, tough luck.

Each step of a kanban board represents each stage of completing a project. Each step has a maximum capacity.

People screw this up by forgetting what kanban does. It protects you from scope creep.

You HAVE to know the capacity of the entire board at one time.

"Help me understand what problem you have, which makes you think kanban will solve"

Kanban would be good for a typical help desk. Kanban helps you  troubleshoot bottlenecks.


# Empirical Evidence

## The three pillars of empirical process control
* Transparency
* Inspection
* Adaptation

## Empirical vs predicitve approach


## Predictive - straight line
Waterfall= predictive

Start with a plan and all requirements

End up with all requirements completed acccording to plan

## Empirical - curvy line, eventually narrows down to median

Start wth a project goal and some priority requirements

End the project goal met

#  The values of scrum

* commitment
* courage
* focus
* respect

# Scrum Basics

## Core Scrum

Scrum as a factory concept. What do you produce.

How to get ahead in your career. Focus on what you produce, not what you do. Direct your time, become outcome oriented.

## Scrum Roles

Chickens and Pigs.

### Stakeholder
Not just your boss, it could be your users. Anyone who has bested intrest in the project.
"chickens" always hungry for more.

Will peck you if they get mad at you.

Has project requirements in their head. Everyone who is not on a scrum team is a stakeholder.


### Product owner - the what and how many
Prioritizes user stories

Weighs incoming work, is it worth it?

Meets with stakeholders. Works closeley with development team.

Responsibilities:
* Understands and exeecutes the product vision
* Is responsible for return on investment
* "The chickenn herder" - prioritized features based on stakeholder needs an d
* has the final say on requirements issues
* reprioritizzed the backlog 
* expectation management
* negoriates AC for work results
* decides whether to release
* decides to continue dev


A good product owner will have:

* The ability and authority to make and stick to decisions. Just say no!
* A broad viewpoint - can see the big picture.
* Willingness to own the product backlog
* The ability to prioritize and make trade-offs
* Regular attendance at the daily scrum meetings
* Engagement (skin in the game)
* should not be a "tyrant"
* should not suffer from tunnelvision
* shuold have a "middle management" role. May not be a manager, but should be involved in the bigger picture.


[The iron triangle](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/project-management/iron-triangle-project-management/)

#### produces

Overall product definition. The vision.

Management of return on investmnet.

#### tasks
The product owner works with stakeholders to gather an articulate requirements.

They work with the team to determine "done/done/done"

Determine the release schedule


### Development Team - the how and how much

The how belongs to you. Choosing the technical approach.

A scum development team will be:
* self managed
* Corss functional with self-managed roles
* About 3-9 members
* Responsible for committing to work
* Authority to meet that commitment int he way they see best
* Work with their product owner as a partner.
* Works in an open, colocated space
  * Distributed teams will need electronic tools much sooner
* a development team is almost autonomous


#### What the Produce

Make and meeet commitments.
#### Tasks

### ScrumMaster - the process

"The chicken manager"

A natural born coach.

The grease between the gears.

Responsibilities:
  Inward facing:
    * keep the process moving
    * help everyone learn and effectively use the Scrum framework
      * you need to be able to be empathetic
    * coach and support the product owner

  Outward Facing:
    * radiate information to the larger organization
    * cool, calm, collected
    * work with management to remove impediemnts
    * "chicken management" - help stakeholders understand how to interact with the scrum process.
    * drive organizational change


#### What the Produce

The removal of impediments
Failitation of the scrum process itself


#### Tasks

Coaches development team
Coaches product owner
Protects team
Drives organizational change.

## Mixing Roles

- Scrum master can be a member on the technical team.
  * If you have SM and teams that are involved, make the team member be SM for a different team.
  * Product owner needs to judge what the team builds. There is a conflict of interst.
  * Scrummaster should not mix a product owner. This is basically a project manager.
  * angela says manager of team members should not be manager. Your manager controls money, job security, etc.
  * scrum master cannot work with more than two seperate teams successfully. Two is iffy, but you better know what you are doing.
  * project managers excel as scummasters. you cannot be a micromanager though.


## What makes or breaks a project

```
Technical issues don't kill projects, people kill projects
- Angela probably
```
* user involvement - the most important, otherwise you have no feedback loop
* executive manager support - the most important part of scrum. There are times when you need to tell stakeholers no
* clear statement of requirement
* proper planning
* realistic expectations - "staying in realityland"
* smaller project milestones
* competent staff
* ownership
* clear vision and objectsives
* hardworking, focuesed staff
* other

## Key elements fo scrum

Scrum is not a methodoology

It is not:
- a methodoology
- easy
- comfortable for some people
- a predictive process

It is:
- a frameowrk
- a way to expose organizaztional impediments
- an empirical process


### Self organization

Self organization is the most critical part.

#### The three key parts of self organization:
1) need to know, what "what we are trying to accomplish" 
  a) a high level description of the end state we need to get to
2) What are the constraints of the project
  a) Due date?
  b) budget?
3) Autonomy
  a) "Stop backseat driving, get out of my hair and let me do my job."
  b) Micromanagement kills scrum

### Team sets own goals and detmines how to meet them

How many requirements that are in the sprint should be 100% decided by the team.

You should also add time in the commitment for things to go wrong.

Product owners hate undercommitment (sandbagging).

When product owners and the team disagrees on sprint goals, what you are seeing is the clash of what both sides think the outcomes will be.

###  Inspect/Adapt

If things aren't working, change.

# The Sprint
A sprint can be 1 to 4 weeks long. It produces a potentially shippable product increment that would be considered "done".


The team decides how much they are willing to commit to produce during a given sprint (based on the last sprint)


Once a sprint begins, the works tatement is "locked down" and does not change until the next sprint.


Concludes with a sprint review, during which the product owner can accept or reject each completed feature, and stakeholders can see the product

### Sprint planning meeting
* produces a sprint commitment
* The "what do you mean by this" meeting
* team clarifies requirements, estimates work, establishes the sprint committment breaks work into tasks


### Daily Scrum / Standup
* produces work coordination for the day
* daily 15 minute meeting in which each team member shareds.
  - What they did yesterday
  - Today
  - Any impediments


### Sprint review

Show stakeholder the "done-ness" of each spring task.


* produce agreement on done-ness
* showoff
* PO rejects/accepts work
* stakeholders may participate.


If the story does not meeet acceptance critiera, it is now accepted. It is "accepted".

If the work isn't done, the story is "rejected"

### Retorspective
* produces process improvement
* team identifies what did and did not work well from a process perspective and how to address improvements in the next sprint.

### Product backlog refinement
Also konwn as "storytime" backlog groming sessions. These meetings improvie the produce backlog.

* most teams benefirt from at least one grooming session per spring
* SM, PO, Dev team, Stakeholders if needed.
* Lay down the ground rules
  * th eproduct owneer has the final say on requirements issues.
* Whe writing stories PO talks and answers questions, someone else scribes.
* Keeep the meeting timeboxed.


# Scrum artifacts

### Product backlog

A list of everything a PO is asking the team to create, in the order she would like it built in.

### Sprint Backlog / Commitment

The backlog items the team has commited to on the spring.

### Shippable Product Increment

Scrum Artifact

### Burndown charts

Graphical representation of the amount of work left to do vs time left.

The y axis is the work remaining after each spring.

This takes into acount: work completed, added, removed, and re-estimated.

You can also create a release burndown chart where you track the total amount of

# How to organization implement scrum

Agile transofmration seems to follow this loosely predicatable path


Focus on roles, mechanics, and then roles

The path to scrum

5: Focus on skill building - get the basics right
4: Welcome the discovery of impedimeents
3: In the beginning, if you have to choose, take attitude over technical skill.
2: Internalize the values and practices of Scrum
1: Don't give up.

```
- exploration
- coordination
- process definition
- strategic alignment
- transformation
```

## Exploration

- lets give this a try
- a handful of people are trained
- agaile adopters feel conflicts between the "old way" and the "new way"

## Coordination "lets get organized"

- Wider scale training (often onsite) and coaching.
- agile advocates begin to emerge
- an improvement in technical practices start to occur

## Process Definition: "let's' build in structure"
- organizational approach to removing impediments
- alignment among th eproduct owners
- an agile toolset is chosen

## Strategic Alignment "Lets push this outward"
- organizational leadership adopts the agile mindset
- the agile mindset affects both strategic and tactical planning
- non-technical departments learn agile practices

## Transformation: "We can do anything"
- individuals have a relentless desire to improve (the organization feelsl it is "on a mission")
- teams and individuals regularly experience "flow"
- the question becomes not "if" something can be done, but "how" it can be done.

# When scrum goes wrong

## The agile dirty dozen

Represent more than tyhpcial proglems in agile adoption. They are a reflection of organizational valuese and beliefs that need to change. Theese values center around: roles, mechanics, culture.


# Scaling

When you need to build something that would require more than one scrum team.

You need to coordinate the two. A product owner will manage the two teams and foster coordination betweeen an requirements as well as a technical level.

Do not trust the "Scaled agile framework" or SAFE

Look at LESS and ScrumXScale


# In-class retro notes


### Problem: Team that don't self manage

Values/beliefs reflected
* People ar eresources
* individuals can't be trusted
* I'm a victim

### Problem: Pproduct owners that don't or cna't fulfill their role

Values/beliefs reflected
* This is a spare time job
* The team should be able to figure this out on their own
* I need to make all of my stakeholders happy

### Problem: ScrumMasters that act like project managers (or helicopter parents)
 
Values/beliefs reflected
* ")the world is a safer place with me in charge"
* "Failure is always bad"
* I am utilately responsible for the outcome of this project

### Problem: Stakeholders that don't play by the rules
Values/beliefs reflected
* my needs are more important than anyone elses
* just this once
* this is a democracy and everyone has a vote

### Problem: Organizations that do not understand or value commitments

Values/beliefs reflected
* If i tell you what I really want, i'll get less
* weel be punished if we miss commmitments
* commitments are all about what you do for me, not what i do for you.

### Problem: Organizations that cannot time box

Values/beliefs reflected
* More time solves all problems
* tasks are more important than outcomes
* adding more time is more important than using time well

### Problem: Organixzations that don't make full use of thte inspect-and-adapt cycle

Values/beliefs reflected
* Working harder (faster) is the only way to improve
* We are already working as efficitvely as we can
* Making improvements means making more work

### Probem: Organizations that neglect to give everyone the agile toolkit.

Values/beliefs reflected
* Prodcut owners are less important than agile teams
* Remote teams are less important that home office teams
* partners and third party vendors are not important to the agile process


### Problem: Thinking of agile as "something the techies do"

Values/beliefs reflected
* The purpose of agile practices is to build software betteer
* There is no reason for human resources, finance, etc to learn about agile
* Agile is tactical - it doesn't affect strategic planning

### Lack of understanidng about what the behaviour you are reinforcing

Values/beliefs reflected
* I'm doing you a afavor by cutting you some slack
* People need to be punished when they fail
* You won't know what to do if i do'nt tell you

### Problem: Not understanidn gthe art of the tradeoff

Values/beliefs reflected
* If we don't make this deadlinle, it's the end of the world
* Every requirement, project, and activity is of equal importance.
* Every want is a need

### Problem: Redefining success and celenrating it


Values/beliefs reflected
* We should focus our attention on the teams with problems
* If people aren't working 60 hour weeks they are being lazy
* Our organizational heros who pull all-nighters are the people who make us successful


# Done, Done Done, Done Done Done

A task is not done, until it is "done, done, done"


Done - AC met
Done Done - AC + Quality Agreements
Done Done Done - A product of value that the user can use



### Quality Agreements - "Done Done"

The level of testing,  regulatory requirements, documentation.


### 

# User Stories

Good user stories follow the invest 

Independend
Negotialbe
Valuable
Estimatable
Sized Appropriably
Testable

A format for writing requirements such that they are independent of impelemtation. User stories allow you to:
* state requirements forom the viewpoitns of different stakeholdrs
* stop talking about the stystem (the system shall) and start talking about how people will use the system
* have a promise for a future conversation.
* the user does not have to understand the how. It is obvious to technical people.
* make up the product backlog and are also called "product backlog items", or PBIs
* `as a ____ I want to ___ so i can ___`


A user story is either done or not done. There is no wishy-washy crap.

When a user story is done, you can put it in a project and ship it.

### Acceptnce Criteria - how epics and tasks are hooked together


* forms the boundaties of a story, what is and what is not in scope
* help us know when a story is complete
* come from the dialog between the team and product owner in the backlog grooming and spring planning meetings
* require the ability to ask good questions.


### Epics - the what


Large user stories are called epics. They neeed to be broken down in to manageable pieces.

#### Breaking down large epics

```
As a yoga studio owner I want a website that will allow me to keep in touch with old and new customer to expand my business

- As the owner I will hire designer to get a proof of the website 
- As a yoga studio I need to get approval of the proof
- As a the owner I need to acquire a domain so users can visit my website.
- As a developer I need recreate the website based off the proof so the project move forward.
- As a develeper I need to build a backend so old and new customer can access their accounts
- As a owner I need a contract form on my website so users can contact me so usines can grow.
- As a current yoga client i want to search for classes by keywords.
```

#### User storie and tasks - the how

Break storeis down into smaller tasks, these are the general actions needed to fulfill the story.

Tasks may have a lot or a little detail. Their main purpose is to server the team.


The scrum team is responsible for creating tasks.

```
As a web customer, i want to make a payment online so i can make my payment the same day it is due"

- Build user unterface
- build business logic layer
- connect frontend and backend
- write unit tests
- code review
- test new component
- run regression tests

```

### Scope limiting questions


# Estimation

Teams use a variety of mehthods to estimate stoires

- T shirt size (relative esimation)
- Fibonacci (relative estimation)
- Powers of 2
- Day/Hours

Teams estimates of user stories are often converted into story points, a scale unique to each team.

The average number of story points delivered by a team each sprint is called their *velocity*

Ask yourseelf, "how many stories can i fit into a two week time box"

### Why relative estimation works

* Humans are terrible at absolute estimation but quite good at relative estimation
* It is  generally faster to estimate to give absolute , and it gets a a team thinking as a group rather than individuals.
* It encourages spending analysis time appropriately.
* Scrum poker allows more junior developers to not hide how tasks hard may be based on the answers of other devs.

Example: 

Rank these dogs by their weight: Cocker Spaniel, Lab Retreiver, Great Dane, Teacup Poodle

```
cocker spaniel 15
lab ret 40
great dane 120
teacup 8

```

Now order them by their relative size.

```
teacup, cocker, lab, dane
```

Even though the exact weights are wrong, it is very easy to guess the size of each breed relative to one another.

Relative estimation is usuall more efficient.

* What is/are one of the biggest?
* Does someone in the group have specialized konwledge about any item?
* can we group the remaining items into relative size groups
* what is/are one of the smallest?

Because user stories are frequently re-estimated as they rise on the backlog, relative estimation becomes the most cost effective way to determine effort.


# "Scrum in the real world"



# Taking the CSM exam
* roles
* meetings
* artifacts
* 3 pillars of process contro
* scrum values
* differences between predictive and empirical projcet management
* basic familiarity with "the new new product development game" article
* basic familiarity with agile manifesto


* if you buy her book
* artifacts 1-37
* roles 39
* artifacts 79
* meetings 119
* stakeholder problems p 62


You have an hour to take the exam once you start
You have 90 days to take the exam after the class.

Scrum certification needs to be renewed every two years. You need to accumulate SEU's, read more on the site.

# Release planning

## Story points

A numeric weight assigned to a relative estimation ranking for the purposes of calculating velocity. For example, fibonacci or powers of 2

The sum of the stories added up is the sprint commitment.

When you divide a story into tasks, you are trying to divide them up into chunks of work that is in chunks of a few hours.

## sprint burndown - hours remaining

- daily summation of work remaining in sprint
- often goes up before it goes down (as tasks get specced)
- is a tool mainly used by the team, product owner, and scrummaster


## Velocity

```
Velocity is the rate at which a given team can produce work from sprint to sprint
```

The appropriate use of velocity is the forward planning that a product owner wants to do.

* used to meausre a teams rate of progress across iterations
  * number of completed story points per sprint
  * stories are either complete or not, no "partial credit"
* Velocy ycan be used to derive durations and extrapolate schedulee
* teams that have a predictable velocty make live much easier for the product owner
* teams can only acheive a predicatable velocity when they are kept together as a unit throughout a "body of work"

# Pressure on Velocity = Technical Debt
If teams are pressured to work above and beond their historical velocity, they cannot change the laws of physics to do so. Instead, they usually resort to:

* cutting corners on quality
* cutting corners on doneness

Teams driven to constantly produce more encounter the problem of technical debt.

## Avoiding technical debt
Deevelopment teams should focus on working smarter, not harder.

Management redirects attention from applying pressure to removing organizational imediments to progress

Product owners understand the triple constraint and the balance between cost, schedule and features.

The ScrumMaster and Product Owner should encourage the team to work at a sustainable (not ever-increasing) pace.





# Transformation to agile

## Rotating scrum rmasters

* pro: share the load
* pro: discover diamonds in the rough.
* con: complex problems might not get solved.

#  Random stuff

* vegas rule (what happens in retro stays there), people will feel less intimidated.


* A big part of being a scrum manager is help the product owner and stakeholders get along

* mixing scrum and waterfall is bad. If you combine too much of one and another you get all of the overhead of both without as many benefits.
* view a release as a "chunk" of value you are releasing at once. Is the effort worth it?
* A good scrum maser will ask questions instead of making demands. Have people explain their thought process (that is wrong) lol
* in a remote world, you should do video calls as opposed to phone only communication.
* keep a scrum team in similar timezones

# Interview questions/advice

* What questions do you have for us?

- how many teams do you have actively doing scrum right now
- so hows scrum going for you?
- how are things going with your product owners?
- (ask highest ranking person), why did you decide to do scrum?

# Notes for retro
* Stakeholders are not just managers. It is anyone who has a vested interest in the product.
* Sprint lenghts don't HAVE to be two weeks long. set a min and max? If the sprint becomes more technically involved, sprint length should increase.
* standup time is still too long. Relevant details only. We ramble too much.
* i don't think we are really retroing right. We all get stuck on dumb things every sprint and never talk about it. `team identifies what did and did not work well from a process perspective and how to address improvements in the next sprint.`
* Standups rarely produce anything other than general status updates. We just ramble. I don't care about the 15 random things you did in your branch. The daily scrum is only to procue team coordination for the day. For example, you are now only allowed to say one sentence for what you are working on yesterday/today
* PO goes last, asks questions at end of scrum meeting, not after each person. They should not interfere with team dynamic.
* Review Acceptance Critiera in sprint review. Review general quality agreement.
* accepting rollover tasks allows bad behavior. We need to stop doing this. The team needs to know why, and fix the cause that makes these rollover tasks happen.
* the "done done done" section shuold be referred to as the spring artifact
* If it is actual code worth writing, it needs tests. This is part of our quality agreement. Fixing tests for a feature you are adding is not "writing tests"
* I want our user story qualilty to improve. It should follow INVEST. it rarely has the WHY
* We need an official documentor for reviews, someone who takes good notes. They write all info in task.
* determine AC as a team, the questions we ask the PO are basically what it should be.
* when we have scope creep, or unforseen AC the task needs to be marked so we can discuss in retro what questions could have been asked. We can all learn.
* sub stories should describe your goal
* we need to have a group discussion for XL tasks. In sprint planning or review, if a task is huge, . We actually spend 5 minutes as a team and fill  in any AC. ask questions.
*  our stories really suck
* we should start writing stories from perspectives outside our own
* the reason we do not complete tasks is because our tasks are not specced out well enough. Think about the last project you did that was a lg, do you think you could have saved time spending a few hours researching, asking questions?
* why are we doing scrum? do you like scrum? what do you think is the purpose of scrum?



Watch for stories that don't ask for anything.

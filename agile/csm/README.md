# Agile CSM Certification Class Notes
# 5/23/21 - 5/24/21

# Getting people into scrum
* important part of being master is bringing peoplei into scrum at their own pace
* Scrum requires intrinsic motivation, you cannot drag people into scrum.


# Purpose of the class
- how to use scrum
- when to use scrum
- not every lesson needs to be learned the hard way  (learn from others mistakes)



# Agile Overview

## Terms
* Framework = agile methods are frameworks, not methodologies; they are very light-weight
* minimizing risk = The guiding purpose and ultimate benefit of Agile Development
* Time box / iterations = instead of BDUF (big design up front) inspect an adpat cycles allow the right choices to make themselves know.
* Working product = scrum is based onn empirical evidence
* impediment = a process or condidion that exists today in your organization that is not in its best long-term interests

## History

The term scrum comes from rugby

Teams seem to be efficient when everyone has their own specialized skillset, they work well together when it is almost like a relay race where you pass the baton off to another person

Rugby requires that you pass behind or aside to you. You have to work as a team. You have to stick together to accomplish your goal.


* Built-in insetabililty
* self-organizing teams
* OOverlapping development phases
* multti-learning
* suble control
* organizational transfer of learning

# Types of agile

Agile is a group of practices

* Individuals and interactions over process and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentaiton
* Customer collaboration over contract negiotiaoin
* responding to change over following a plan



```
...a conceptual framework for developing new products that seeks to minimize risk and maximize value by working in time-boxed iterattions and emphasizing working product as the primary measure of success
```
*--30 days to better agile*


What scrum brings you The most business value possible for the time and money you have to spend.

This allows teams to not do low value work, they work harder. Not smarter.


## SCRUM
 

### what does it even do?


Wit scrum every day you kjonw exactly
* what work is complete
* what is left to do
* How does whats left compare with with time left to do it


Iterate. Inspect. Adapt.

Summed up. It is an agille project management framework. An approach for managing projects or other bodies of work. It exposes organizational impediments

# Complex projects
The worst part about the project is what you don't know.


# Anarchy

You don't want a project to be in anarchy, always be in control.
# Waterfall projects

Also called defined processes. As soon as any of these are not the case, SCRUM is better.

* Short
* Well understood
* Have already done many times
### Where scrum can help

1) project of higher than average risk
  a) big (long, lots of people)
2) One of more of resources is uncomfortably limited
3) A project that has emerging requirements

## XP

XP improves technical quality. Typically used by small companies, typically cutting edge tech.

* TCO - total cost ownership. The amount of cost for technical debt and maintencance.

## Lean

Continious improvement, eliminiate waste.

## Kanban

You have a list of things. If space opens up, you have an opening and take somethting off backlog. Otherwise, tough luck.

Each step of a kanban board represents each stage of completing a project. Each step has a maximum capacity.

People screw this up by forgetting what kanban does. It protects you from scope creep.

You HAVE to know the capacity of the entire board at one time.

"Help me understand what problem you have, which makes you think kanban will solve"

Kanban would be good for a typical help desk. Kanban helps you  troubleshoot bottlenecks.


# Empirical Evidence

## The three pillars of empirical process control
* Transparency
* Inspection
* Adaptation

## Empirical vs predicitve approach


## Predictive - straight line
Waterfall= predictive

Start with a plan and all requirements

End up with all requirements completed acccording to plan

## Empirical - curvy line, eventually narrows down to median

Start wth a project goal and some priority requirements

End the project goal met

#  The values of scrum

* commitment
* courage
* focus
* respect

# Scrum Basics

## Core Scrum

Scrum as a factory concept. What do you produce.

How to get ahead in your career. Focus on what you produce, not what you do. Direct your time, become outcome oriented.

## Scrum Roles

Chickens and Pigs.

### Stakeholder
Not just your boss, it could be your users. Anyone who has bested intrest in the project.
"chickens" always hungry for more.

Will peck you if they get mad at you.

Has project requirements in their head. Everyone who is not on a scrum team is a stakeholder.


### Product owner - the what and how many
Prioritizes user stories

Weighs incoming work, is it worth it?

Meets with stakeholders. Works closeley with development team.

#### produces

Overall product definition. The vision.

Management of return on investmnet.

#### tasks
The product owner works with stakeholders to gather an articulate requirements.

They work with the team to determine "done/done/done"

Determine the release schedule


### Development Team - the how and how much

The how belongs to you. Choosing the technical approach.


#### What the Produce

Make and meeet commitments.
#### Tasks

### ScrumMaster - the process

"The chicken manager"

The grease between the gears.

#### What the Produce

The removal of impediments
Failitation of the scrum process itself


#### Tasks

Coaches development team
Coaches product owner
Protects team
Drives organizational change.


## What makes or breaks a project

```
Technical issues don't kill projects, people kill projects
- Angela probably
```
* user involvement - the most important, otherwise you have no feedback loop
* executive manager support - the most important part of scrum. There are times when you need to tell stakeholers no
* clear statement of requirement
* proper planning
* realistic expectations - "staying in realityland"
* smaller project milestones
* competent staff
* ownership
* clear vision and objectsives
* hardworking, focuesed staff
* other

## Key elements fo scrum

Scrum is not a methodoology

It is not:
- a methodoology
- easy
- comfortable for some people
- a predictive process

It is:
- a frameowrk
- a way to expose organizaztional impediments
- an empirical process


### Self organization

Self organization is the most critical part.

#### The three key parts of self organization:
1) need to know, what "what we are trying to accomplish" 
  a) a high level description of the end state we need to get to
2) What are the constraints of the project
  a) Due date?
  b) budget?
3) Autonomy
  a) "Stop backseat driving, get out of my hair and let me do my job."
  b) Micromanagement kills scrum

### Team sets own goals and detmines how to meet them

How many requirements that are in the sprint should be 100% decided by the team.

You should also add time in the commitment for things to go wrong.

Product owners hate undercommitment (sandbagging).

When product owners and the team disagrees on sprint goals, what you are seeing is the clash of what both sides think the outcomes will be.

###  Inspect/Adapt

If things aren't working, change.

# The Sprint
A sprint can be 1 to 4 weeks long. It produces a potentially shippable product increment that would be considered "done".


The team decides how much they are willing to commit to produce during a given sprint (based on the last sprint)


Once a sprint begins, the works tatement is "locked down" and does not change until the next sprint.


Concludes with a sprint review, during which the product owner can accept or reject each completed feature, and stakeholders can see the product

### Sprint planning meeting
* produces a sprint commitment
* The "what do you mean by this" meeting
* team clarifies requirements, estimates work, establishes the sprint committment breaks work into tasks


### Daily Scrum / Standup
* produces work coordination for the day
* daily 15 minute meeting in which each team member shareds.
  - What they did yesterday
  - Today
  - Any impediments


### Sprint review

Show stakeholder the "done-ness" of each spring task.


* produce agreement on done-ness
* showoff
* PO rejects/accepts work
* stakeholders may participate.


If the story does not meeet acceptance critiera, it is now accepted. It is "accepted".

If the work isn't done, the story is "rejected"

### Retorspective
* produces process improvement
* team identifies what did and did not work well from a process perspective and how to address improvements in the next sprint.

### Product backlog refinement
Also konwn as "storytime" backlog groming sessions. These meetings improvie the produce backlog.

* most teams benefirt from at least one grooming session per spring
* SM, PO, Dev team, Stakeholders if needed.
* Lay down the ground rules
  * th eproduct owneer has the final say on requirements issues.
* Whe writing stories PO talks and answers questions, someone else scribes.
* Keeep the meeting timeboxed.


# Scrum artifacts

### Product backlog

A list of everything a PO is asking the team to create, in the order she would like it built in.

### Sprint Backlog / Commitment

The backlog items the team has commited to on the spring.

### Shippable Product Increment

Scrum Artifact

### Burndown charts

Graphical representation of the amount of work left to do vs time left.

# Done, Done Done, Done Done Done

A task is not done, until it is "done, done, done"


Done - AC met
Done Done - AC + Quality Agreements
Done Done Done - A product of value that the user can use



### Quality Agreements - "Done Done"

The level of testing,  regulatory requirements, documentation.


### 

# User Stories

Good user stories follow the invest 

Independend
Negotialbe
Valuable
Estimatable
Sized Appropriably
Testable

A format for writing requirements such that they are independent of impelemtation. User stories allow you to:
* state requirements forom the viewpoitns of different stakeholdrs
* stop talking about the stystem (the system shall) and start talking about how people will use the system
* have a promise for a future conversation.
* the user does not have to understand the how. It is obvious to technical people.
* make up the product backlog and are also called "product backlog items", or PBIs
* `as a ____ I want to ___ so i can ___`


A user story is either done or not done. There is no wishy-washy crap.

When a user story is done, you can put it in a project and ship it.

### Acceptnce Criteria - how epics and tasks are hooked together


* forms the boundaties of a story, what is and what is not in scope
* help us know when a story is complete
* come from the dialog between the team and product owner in the backlog grooming and spring planning meetings
* require the ability to ask good questions.


### Epics - the what


Large user stories are called epics. They neeed to be broken down in to manageable pieces.

#### Breaking down large epics

```
As a yoga studio owner I want a website that will allow me to keep in touch with old and new customer to expand my business

- As the owner I will hire designer to get a proof of the website 
- As a yoga studio I need to get approval of the proof
- As a the owner I need to acquire a domain so users can visit my website.
- As a developer I need recreate the website based off the proof so the project move forward.
- As a develeper I need to build a backend so old and new customer can access their accounts
- As a owner I need a contract form on my website so users can contact me so usines can grow.
- As a current yoga client i want to search for classes by keywords.
```

#### User storie and tasks - the how

Break storeis down into smaller tasks, these are the general actions needed to fulfill the story.

Tasks may have a lot or a little detail. Their main purpose is to server the team.


The scrum team is responsible for creating tasks.

```
As a web customer, i want to make a payment online so i can make my payment the same day it is due"

- Build user unterface
- build business logic layer
- connect frontend and backend
- write unit tests
- code review
- test new component
- run regression tests

```

### Scope limiting questions


# Estimation

# "Scrum in the real world"

# Taking the CSM exam


# Release planning

# Transformation to agile

## Rotating scrum masters

* pro: share the load
* pro: discover diamonds in the rough.
* con: complex problems might not get solved.

#  Random stuff

* vegas rule (what happens in retro stays there), people will feel less intimidated.


* A big part of being a scrum manager is help the product owner and stakeholders get along

* mixing scrum and waterfall is bad. If you combine too much of one and another you get all of the overhead of both without as many benefits.
* view a release as a "chunk" of value you are releasing at once. Is the effort worth it?


# Exam reviw
* [the new new product development guide](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game)
* [The agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)




# Notes for retro
* Stakeholders are not just managers. It is anyone who has a vested interest in the product.
* Sprint lenghts don't HAVE to be two weeks long. set a min and max? If the sprint becomes more technically involved, sprint length should increase.
* standup time is still too long. Relevant details only. We ramble too much.
* i don't think we are really retroing right. We all get stuck on dumb things every sprint and never talk about it. `team identifies what did and did not work well from a process perspective and how to address improvements in the next sprint.`
* Standups rarely produce anything other than general status updates. We just ramble. I don't care about the 15 random things you did in your branch. The daily scrum is only to procue team coordination for the day. For example, you are now only allowed to say one sentence for what you are working on yesterday/today
* PO goes last, asks questions at end of scrum meeting, not after each person. They should not interfere with team dynamic.
* Review Acceptance Critiera in sprint review. Review general quality agreement.
* accepting rollover tasks allows bad behavior. We need to stop doing this. The team needs to know why, and fix the cause that makes these rollover tasks happen.
* the "done done done" section shuold be referred to as the spring artifact
* If it is actual code worth writing, it needs tests. This is part of our quality agreement. Fixing tests for a feature you are adding is not "writing tests"
* I want our user story qualilty to improve. It should follow INVEST. it rarely has the WHY
* We need an official documentor for reviews, someone who takes good notes. They write all info in task.
* determine AC as a team, the questions we ask the PO are basically what it should be.
* when we have scope creep, or unforseen AC the task needs to be marked so we can discuss in retro what questions could have been asked. We can all learn.
* sub stories should describe your goal
* we need to have a group discussion for XL tasks. In sprint planning or review, if a task is huge, . We actually spend 5 minutes as a team and fill  in any AC. ask questions.
*  our stories really suck
* we should start writing stories from perspectives outside our own


Watch for stories that don't ask for anything.
